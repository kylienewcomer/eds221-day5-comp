library(testthat)
library(devtools)
library(remotes)
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
```

This function is going to fine the mean value of each column, and then return the lowest and highest mean value calculated (in that order)
Expectations:
- the output should be numeric
- output should be a vector of length 2
-the first value should be smaller than the second value


```{r}
mean_range <- function(df){
  #return mean, max, and min
  col_means <- apply(X = df, MARGIN = 2, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
  col_mean_max <- max(col_means)
  col_mean_min <- min(col_means)
  
  return(c(col_mean_min, col_mean_max))
}

mean_range(df=mtcars)

```
Write some unit tests

```{r, include=FALSE}
#test that the output is of length 2
expect_length(mean_range(df = mtcars),2)


```
